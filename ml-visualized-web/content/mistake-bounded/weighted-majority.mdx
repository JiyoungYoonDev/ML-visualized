# Weighted Majority

Experts give predictions <Math math="x_i(t)\\in\\{0,1\\}" />. Each expert has a weight <Math math="w_i(t)" />.

## Rule (Math)

Vote for label 1 using:

<Math block math={'\\sum_{i:x_i(t)=1} w_i(t)'} />

Vote for label 0 using:

<Math block math={'\\sum_{i:x_i(t)=0} w_i(t)'} />

Predict 1 if the 1-side is larger (else 0).
